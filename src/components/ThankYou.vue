            snippets that made this really easy to implement.</p>

            Originally created by pancake3000, improved and refined by redd-ravenn,
            and further expanded here with multi-account login management,
            a guided step-by-step workflow, backup/restore support,
            catalog hiding and reordering (including Cinemeta),
            and per-addon catalog editing without touching JSON.
