        <h3>Thank you</h3>
        <p>Big thank you to <code>Sleeyax</code> and <code>&#60;Code/&#62;</code> for the conversations and code
            snippets that made this really easy to implement.</p>

            Originally created by pancake3000, improved and refined by redd-ravenn,
            and further expanded here with multi-account login management,
            a guided step-by-step workflow, backup/restore support,
            catalog search functionality, addon installation and reset features,
            catalog hiding and reordering (including Cinemeta),
            per-addon catalog editing without touching JSON,
            and smart visual feedback for unsaved changes and sync requirements.
